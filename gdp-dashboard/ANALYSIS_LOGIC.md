- **Count**: Total number of non-null records

### **Purpose**
- Understand data distribution and central tendency
- Identify potential outliers and data quality issues
- Establish baseline metrics for comparison
- Detect unusual patterns in numeric data

### **Statistical Foundation**
- Uses standard statistical measures (mean, std dev)
- Handles missing values appropriately
- Provides foundation for more advanced analysis

### **Business Value**
- Quick overview of data health
- Identify data quality issues early
- Support decision-making with baseline metrics

### **Correlation Interpretation**
- **-1.0 to -0.7**: Strong negative correlation
- **-0.7 to -0.3**: Moderate negative correlation
- **-0.3 to 0.3**: Weak or no correlation
- **0.3 to 0.7**: Moderate positive correlation
- **0.7 to 1.0**: Strong positive correlation

### **Business Value**
- Identify key business drivers
- Optimize product/service offerings
- Understand customer behavior patterns
- Support predictive modeling efforts

## üö® 6. Outlier Detection

### **Logic & Methodology**
- **IQR Method**: Uses Interquartile Range for outlier detection
- **Quartile Calculation**: Q1 (25th percentile), Q3 (75th percentile)
- **Outlier Boundaries**: Q1 - 1.5√óIQR and Q3 + 1.5√óIQR
- **Outlier Count**: Number of values beyond boundaries

### **Purpose**
- Identify extreme values that could skew analysis
- Detect data quality issues or errors
- Ensure robust statistical analysis
- Plan data cleaning strategies

### **IQR Method Benefits**
- Robust to extreme values
- Statistically sound approach
